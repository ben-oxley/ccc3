This year's christmas coding challenge is winter wonderland!

Create the most complex christmas scene you can in an 80x20 command prompt window (or any other output window).

Rules:
0) You can enter in any language you want, be it Java, Matlab, C++
1) The code must be a maximum of 200 characters for the entire submission. Code wisely!
2) Christmas is about sharing! Send it to anyone else in the company who you think would want to enter.
3) No external libraries allowed, it has to be included in the standard language. E.g. stdio is fine. christmascodinganswer.dll is not.
4) Submissions by the EOD on the 12th day of Christmas (midnight, 5th of Jan).
5) The winner will be chosen based on the awesomeness of their winter wonderland. I want to see animation, colour and anything else you can manage. The judging will be subjective and the winner is final (you heard me lewis!).
6) As usual, no fortran.
7) Email me for any clarification of the rules if required. 
The winner gets a nothing but a feeling of superiority over their fellow nerds.
